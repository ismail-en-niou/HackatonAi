## Handling Precautions

## Camera Care

- This camera is a precision instrument. Do not drop it or subject it to physical shock.
- The camera is not waterproof and cannot be used underwater. If you accidentally drop the camera into water, promptly consult your nearest Canon Service Center. Wipe off any water droplets with a dry cloth. If the camera has been exposed to salty air, wipe it with a well-wrung wet cloth.
- Never leave the camera near anything having a strong magnetic field such as a magnet or electric motor. Also avoid using or leaving the camera near anything emitting strong radio waves such as a large antenna. Strong magnetic fields can cause camera misoperation or destroy image data.
- If the camera is suddenly brought in from the cold into a warm room, condensation may form on the camera and internal parts. To prevent condensation, first put the camera in a sealed plastic bag and let it adjust to the warmer temperature before taking it out of the bag.
- Do not leave the camera in excessive heat such as in a car in direct sunlight. High temperatures can cause the camera to malfunction. The camera contains precision electronic circuitry. Never attempt to disassemble the camera yourself. Use a blower to blow away dust on the lens, viewfinder, reflex mirror, and focusing screen. Do not use cleaners that contain organic solvents to clean the camera body or lens. For stubborn dirt, take the camera to the nearest Canon Service Center. Do not touch the camera's electrical contacts with your fingers. This is to prevent the contacts from corroding. Corroded contacts can cause camera misoperation. %12;
- If condensation forms on the camera, do not use the camera. This is to avoid damaging the camera. If there is condensation, remove the lens, card and battery from the camera, and wait until the condensation has evaporated before using the camera.
- If the camera will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery and store the camera in a cool, dry, well-ventilated location. Even while the camera is in storage, press the shutter button a few times once in a while to check that the camera is still working.
- Avoid storing the camera where there are corrosive chemicals such as a darkroom or chemical lab.
- If the camera has not been used for an extended period, test all its functions before using it. If you have not used the camera for some time or if there is an important shoot coming up, have the camera checked by your Canon dealer or check the camera yourself and make sure it is working properly.

## LCD Monitor

- Although the LCD monitor is manufactured with very high precision technology with over 99.99% effective pixels, there might be a few dead pixels among the remaining 0.01% or less pixels. Dead pixels displaying only black or red, etc., are not a malfunction. They do not affect the images recorded.
- If the LCD monitor is left on for a prolonged period, screen burn-in may occur where you see remnants of what was displayed. However, this is only temporary and will disappear when the camera is left unused for a few days.
- In low or high temperatures, the LCD monitor display may seem slow or it might look black. It will return to normal at room temperature.

## Cards

To protect the card and its recorded data, note the following:

- Do not drop, bend, or wet the card. Do not subject it to excessive force, physical shock, or vibration.
- Do not touch the card's electronic contacts with your fingers or anything metallic.
- Do not store or use the card near anything having a strong magnetic field such as a TV set, speakers, or magnet. Also avoid places prone to having static electricity.
- Do not leave the card in direct sunlight or near a heat source.
- Store the card in a case.
- Do not store the card in hot, dusty, or humid locations.

## Lens

%12;

After detaching the lens from the camera, attach the lens caps or put down the lens with the rear end up to avoid scratching the lens surface and electrical contacts.

## Cautions During Prolonged Use

If you use continuous shooting, Live View shooting, or movie shooting for a prolonged period, the camera may become hot. Although this is not a malfunction, holding the hot camera for a long period can cause slight skin burns.

## About smudges adhering to the front of the sensor

Besides dust entering the camera from outside, in rare cases lubricant from the camera's internal parts may adhere to the front of the sensor. If visible spots remain on the image, having the sensor cleaned by a Canon Service Center is recommended.

To detach the battery, follow the above procedure in reverse. 3 Recharge the battery. For LC-E10 As shown by the arrow, flip out the battery charger's prongs and insert the prongs into a power outlet. For LC-E10E Connect the power cord to the charger and insert the plug into the power outlet. %12;

- As shown in the illustration, attach the battery securely to the charger.
- X Recharging starts automatically and the charge lamp turns orange.
- X When the battery is fully recharged, the full-charge lamp will turn green.
- It takes approx. 2 hours to fully recharge a completely exhausted battery at 23 ° C / 73 ° F. The time required to recharge the battery depends on the ambient temperature and the battery's charge level.
- For safety reasons, recharging in low temperatures (6°C - 10°C / 43°F - 50°F) will take a longer time (up to 4 hours).

## Tips for Using the Battery and Charger

- Upon purchase, the battery is not fully charged. Recharge the battery before using.
- Recharge the battery on the day before or on the day it is to be used. Even during storage, a charged battery will gradually drain and lose its power.
- The battery charger can also be used in foreign countries. The battery charger is compatible with a 100 V AC to 240 V AC 50/ 60 Hz power source. If necessary, attach a commercially-available plug adapter for the respective country or region. Do not attach any portable voltage transformer to the battery charger. Doing so can damage the battery charger.
- After recharging the battery, detach it and unplug the charger from the power outlet. When not using the camera, remove the battery. If the battery is left in the camera for a prolonged period, a small amount of power current is released, resulting in excess discharge and shorter battery life. Store the battery with the protective cover (provided) attached. Storing the battery after it is fully charged can lower the battery's performance. %12;
- If the battery becomes exhausted quickly even after being fully charged, the battery has reached the end of its service life. Purchase a new battery.
- After disconnecting the charger's power plug, do not touch the prongs for at least 3 sec.
- Do not charge any battery other than a Battery Pack LP-E10.
- The Battery Pack LP-E10 is dedicated to Canon products only. Using it with an incompatible battery charger or product may result in malfunction or accidents for which Canon cannot be held liable.

## Installing and Removing the Battery and Card

## Set the IS switch to &lt; 1 &gt;.

- Set also the camera's power switch to &lt; 1 &gt;.

2 Press the shutter button halfway. X The Image Stabilizer will operate. 3 Take the picture. When the picture looks steady in the viewfinder, press the shutter button completely to take the picture. %12;

- The Image Stabilizer may not be effective if the subject moves at the time of exposure.
- The Image Stabilizer may not be effective for excessive shaking such as on a rocking boat.
- The Image Stabilizer can operate with the focus mode switch set to either &lt; f &gt; or &lt; g &gt;.
- If the camera is mounted on a tripod, you can save battery power by switching the IS switch to &lt; 2 &gt;.
- The Image Stabilizer is effective even when the camera is mounted on a monopod.
- Some IS lenses enable you to switch the IS mode manually to suit the shooting conditions. However, the EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II and EFS55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS II switch the IS mode automatically.

## Basic Operation

## Adjusting the Viewfinder Clarity

<!-- image -->

Turn the dioptric adjustment knob.

- Turn the knob left or right until the nine AF points in the viewfinder look sharp.
- If the camera's dioptric adjustment still cannot provide a sharp viewfinder image, using Dioptric Adjustment Lens E (10 types, sold separately) is recommended.

## Holding the Camera

To obtain sharp images, hold the camera still to minimize camera shake.

Basic Shooting This chapter explains how to use the Basic Zone modes on the Mode Dial for best results. With Basic Zone modes, all you do is point and shoot and the camera sets everything automatically (p.54). Also, to prevent botched pictures due to mistaken operations, major shooting settings cannot be changed in fully-automatic modes. %12;

<!-- image -->

- 1 Set the Mode Dial to &lt; 1 &gt;.

## 2 Aim any AF point over the subject.

- All the AF points will be used to focus, and generally the closest object will be focused.
- Aiming the center AF point over the subject will make focusing easier. 3 Focus the subject. Press the shutter button halfway, and the lens focusing ring will rotate to focus. X The dot inside the AF point achieving focus flashes briefly in red. At the same time, the beeper will sound and the focus confirmation light &lt; o &gt; in the viewfinder will light. %12;
- X If necessary, the built-in flash will popup automatically.

## Take the picture.

- Press the shutter button completely to take the picture.
- X The captured image will be displayed for approx. 2 sec. on the LCD monitor.
- If the built-in flash has popped up, you can push it back down with your fingers.

<!-- image -->

- The focus confirmation light &lt; o &gt; blinks and focus is not achieved. Aim the AF point over an area having good contrast, then press the shutter button halfway (p.33). If you are too close to the subject, move away and try again.
- Sometimes multiple AF points flash simultaneously. This indicates that focus has been achieved at all those AF points. When the AF point covering the desired subject flashes, take the picture.
- The beeper continues to beep softly. (The focus confirmation light &lt; o &gt; does not light.) It indicates that the camera is focusing continuously on a moving subject. (The focus confirmation light &lt; o &gt; does not light.) You can take sharp pictures of a moving subject. Pressing the shutter button halfway does not focus the subject. If the focus mode switch on the lens is set to &lt; MF &gt; (Manual Focus), set it to &lt; AF &gt; (Auto Focus). Although it is daylight, the flash popped up. For a backlit subject, the flash may pop up to help lighten the subject's dark areas. %12;
- In low light, the built-in flash fired a series of flashes. Pressing the shutter button halfway may trigger the built-in flash to fire a series of flashes to assist autofocusing. This is called AF-assist beam. Its effective range is about 4 meters/13.1 feet.
- Although flash was used, the picture came out dark. The subject was too far away. The subject should be within 5 meters/16.4 feet from the camera.
- When flash was used, the bottom part of the picture came out unnaturally dark.

The subject was too close to the camera, and a shadow was created by the lens barrel. The subject should be at least 1 meter/3.3 feet away from the camera. If a hood has been attached to the lens, remove it before taking the flash picture.

## 1 Full Auto Techniques

## Recomposing the Shot

<!-- image -->

Depending on the scene, position the subject toward the left or right to create a balanced background and good perspective.

In the &lt; 1 &gt; (Full Auto) mode, while you press the shutter button halfway to focus a still subject, the focus will be locked. You can then recompose the shot and press the shutter button completely to take the picture. This is called 'focus lock'. Focus lock is also possible in other Basic Zone modes (except &lt; 5 &gt; Sports). Shooting a Moving Subject COPY

<!-- image -->

In the &lt; 1 &gt; (Full Auto) mode, if the subject moves (distance to camera changes) during or after you focus, AI Servo AF will take effect to focus the subject continuously. As long as you keep aiming the AF point on the subject while pressing the shutter button halfway, the focusing will be continuous. When you want to take the picture, press the shutter button completely.

<!-- image -->

## 7 Disabling Flash

In places where flash photography is prohibited, use the &lt; 7 &gt; (Flash Off) mode. This mode is also effective for capturing the particular ambience of a scene, such as candlelight scenes.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Shooting Tips

- Prevent camera shake if the numeric display in the viewfinder blinks.

%12;

Under low light when camera shake is prone to occur, the viewfinder's shutter speed display will blink. Hold the camera steady or use a tripod. When using a zoom lens, use the wide-angle end to reduce blur caused by camera shake.

- Taking portraits without flash.

In low-light conditions, tell the subject to keep still until the picture is taken. If the person moves during the exposure, he or she might look blurred in the picture.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## C Creative Auto Shooting

Unlike the &lt; 1 &gt; Full Auto mode where the camera sets everything, the &lt; C &gt; Creative Auto mode enables you to easily change the depth of field, drive mode, and flash firing.

You can also choose the ambience you want to convey in your images. The default setting is the same as the &lt; 1 &gt; (Full Auto) mode.

* CA stands for Creative Auto.

- When using &lt; b &gt;, see 'Disabling Flash' on page 45.

<!-- image -->

## 2 Shooting Portraits

The &lt; 2 &gt; (Portrait) mode blurs the background to make the human subject stand out. It also makes skin tones and the hair look softer than with the &lt; 1 &gt; (Full Auto) mode.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Shooting Tips

- The further the distance between the subject and background, the better.

%12;

The further the distance between the subject and background, the more blurred the background will look. The subject will also stand out better in front of a plain, dark background.

- Use a telephoto lens.
- If you have a zoom lens, use the telephoto end to fill the frame with

the subject from the waist up. Move in closer if necessary.

- Focus the face.

Check that the AF point covering the face flashes in red.

- If you hold down the shutter button, you can shoot continuously to obtain different poses and facial expressions. (Up to approx. 3 shots per sec. in JPEG quality.)
- If necessary, the built-in flash will pop up automatically.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 3 Shooting Landscapes

Use the &lt; 3 &gt; (Landscape) mode for wide scenery, night scenes, or to have everything in focus from near to far. The greens and blues also become more vivid and the image sharper than with &lt; 1 &gt; (Full Auto).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Shooting Tips

- With a zoom lens, use the wide-angle end.

When using the wide-angle end of a zoom lens, objects near and far will be in focus better than at the telephoto end. It also adds breadth to landscapes.

%12;

- Shooting night scenes.
- Since the built-in flash will be disabled, this &gt; is also good for night scenes. If you want to photograph a person against

mode &lt; 3 Use a tripod to prevent camera shake. a night scene, set the Mode Dial to &lt; 6 &gt; (Night Portrait) and use a tripod (p.53).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 4 Shooting Close-ups

When you want to photograph flowers or small things up close, use the &lt; 4 &gt; (Close-up) mode. To make small things appear much larger, use a macro lens (sold separately).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Shooting Tips

- Use a simple background.

A simple background makes the flower, etc., stand out better.

%12;

- Move to the subject as close as possible. Check the lens for its minimum focusing distance. Some lenses have indications such as &lt; 4 0.25m/0.8ft &gt;. The lens minimum focusing distance is measured from the &lt; V &gt; (focal plane) mark on the top left of the camera to the subject. If you are too close to the subject, the focus confirmation light &lt; o &gt; will blink. Under low light, the built-in flash will fire. If you are too close to the subject and the bottom of the picture looks dark, move away from the subject.

- Keep the person within 5 meters/16.4 feet from the camera. Under low light, the built-in flash will fire automatically to obtain a good exposure of the person. The maximum effective distance of the built-in flash is 5 meters/16.4 feet from the camera.
- Shoot also with &lt; 1 &gt; (Full Auto). Since camera shake is prone to occur with night shots, shooting also with &lt; 1 &gt; (Full Auto) is recommended.
- Tell the subject to keep still even after the flash fires.
- If you use the self-timer together with flash, the self-timer lamp will light briefly after the picture is taken.

## Shooting with the LCD Monitor (Live View Shooting)

You can shoot while viewing the image on the camera's LCD monitor. This is called 'Live View shooting'. Live View shooting is effective for still subjects which do not move. COPY

If you handhold the camera and shoot while viewing the LCD monitor, camera shake can cause blurred images. Using a tripod is recommended.

For other functions, more details, and cautions related to Live View shooting, see the Camera Instruction Manual (PDF) in the Camera Instruction Manual CDROM.

## About Remote Live View Shooting

With EOS Utility (provided software, p.76) installed in your computer, you can connect the camera to the computer and shoot remotely while viewing the computer screen. For details, see the Software Instruction Manual (p.78) in the CD-ROM.

- Keep the camera from the reach of small children. The neck strap can accidentally choke the child.
- Do not store the equipment in dusty or humid places. This is to prevent fire and electrical shock.
- Before using the camera inside an airplane or hospital, check if it is allowed. Electromagnetic waves emitted by the camera may interfere with the plane's instruments or the hospital's medical equipment.
- To prevent fire and electrical shock, follow the safeguards below:
- -Always insert the power plug all the way in.
- -Do not handle a power plug with wet hands.
- -When unplugging a power plug, grasp and pull the plug instead of the cord.
- Do not leave equipment inside a car under the hot sun or near a heat source. The equipment may become hot and cause skin burns.
- -Do not scratch, cut, or excessively bend the cord or put a heavy object on the cord. Also do not twist or tie the cords. -Do not connect too many power plugs to the same power outlet. -Do not use a cord whose insulation has been damaged. · Occasionally unplug the power plug and use a dry cloth to clean off the dust around the power outlet. If the surrounding is dusty, humid, or oily, the dust on the power outlet may become moist and short-circuit the outlet to cause a fire. Preventing Injury or Equipment Damage COPY
- Do not carry the camera around while it is attached to a tripod. Doing so may cause injury. Also make sure the tripod is sturdy enough to support the camera and lens.
- Do not leave a lens or lens-attached camera under the sun without the lens cap attached. Otherwise, the lens may concentrate the sun's rays and cause a fire.
- Do not cover or wrap the battery-recharging apparatus with a cloth. Doing so may trap heat within and cause the casing to deform or catch fire.
- If you drop the camera in water or if water or metal fragments enter inside the camera, promptly remove the battery pack and back-up battery. This is to prevent fire and electrical shock.
- Do not use or leave the battery pack or back-up battery in a hot environment. Doing so may cause battery leakage or a shorter battery life. The battery pack or back-up battery can also become hot and cause skin burns.
- Do not use paint thinner, benzene, or other organic solvents to clean the equipment. Doing so may cause fire or a health hazard.
